### Setup
chip.py uses python 2.7 and two packages that are not included in the standard library. These are numpy and matplotlib
and can be installed using PIP just running:

pip install matplotlib numpy

Depending on your python distribution you might need to install python TKinter. If you need so just run

sudo apt install python-tk


### Running chip
In order to run the code just run

python chip.py -f mappings-file -o output-file

-f and -0 are required inputs
