Selo.py uses python 2.7 and two packages that are not included in the standard library. These are numpy and matplotlib
and can be installed using PIP just running:

pip install matplotlib numpy

Depending on your python distribution you might need to install python TKinter. If you need so just run

sudo apt install python-tk


In order to run the code just run

python selo.py [filename]

If no filename is added, selo will use the file called 'demo-input.txt' and will create a png called 'demo-input.png'
